### Description
This is a app that allows users to create logs of wildlife sightings (species, time, date, description, image) and add those logs to a map of all wildlife sightings in their area. The user will be able to choose to view either all logs near their gps location or input an address. The MVP (minimum viable product) consists of the previous mentioned functionality. Further functionality will consist of
 1) being able to filter results (on map) based on species, rating, date, and species+location 
 2) creating an API for other developers to use the data 
 3) adding an upvote/downvote to logs 
 4) adding a rating system for species(endangered, dangerous, or hurt animals). 
 5) user authentication will be implemented to allow users to create accounts/sign in/sign out and view their log history.
